\section{Objectives and Problem Description}

The objectives of this lab were to learn the basics of the Stamp 2 board, setup the programming+debugging toolchain, and complete two projects with the simplest actuators available: LEDs and pushbutton switches.

\subsection{Traffic Light Controller}

The first project is the traffic light controller, which models two traffic lights at an intersection between a major and minor road. There are 6 LEDs--2 red, 2 yellow, 2 green--and a pushbutton switch representing a magnetic presence sensor on the minor road. The major road should always remain green unless the minor road pushbutton is triggered. This trigger causes a transistion following normal traffic signals, with 5 second delays between each signal permutation and 10 seconds green duration on the minor road.

\subsection{Jeopardy Style Game}

The second project has two pushbutton representing Jeopardy buzzers and some indicator LEDs.
When the go LED turns on, two players compete to buzz in the quickest.
The winner is displayed via LEDs and the winning player's reaction time is printed to the debug terminal.
To make the game more difficult and competitive, the go LED is delayed by a random amount of time.
