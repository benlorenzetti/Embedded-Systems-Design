\section{Objectives and Problem Description}

\subsection{Part 1: Does the Switch Bounce?}
\label{part-1-problem-specs}

\subsection{Part 2: Catch the Clown!}
\label{part-2-problem-specs}

Build a game for testing reaction times with an 8 LED rotating display,
a pushbutton trigger, and a knob for adjusting the speed/difficulty.
If the player presses the trigger in sync with
the LED display, then the display stops rotating to indicate victory.
The specifications can be summarized in the four points below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For an 8 LED display, one LED should be illuminated at a time and
the illuminated position should rotate right one digit every period.
\item The period should be adjustable on the fly with the rotatry potentiometer knob.
\item If the user triggers the switch while the topmost (most significant bit) 
LED is illuminated, then the LED display should stop rotating
until the switch is released. The LED rotation loop should also continue--\mbox{including
through the topmost state}--if the switch is active but was triggered
during the wrong state.
\item The pushbutton switch should be debounced based on the results from
part 1.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Procedure}

\subsection{Switch Bounce Background}

Mechanical switches do not always produce clean, step function electrical signals.
Instead, when a switch is thrown, the electric signal often `bounces' several times
before settling at the active level. This is caused by electric arcing and breaking
as the contacts near one other and from mechanical vibrations of contacts from the
throwing force.

Bouncing can cause problems if the device's function depends on the number of times
a switch is thrown. For example, if you keyboard bounced, you would find yourself
typing repeat letters and unpredictable backspacing. Traditionally switches were
`debounced' with low pass filters in hardware, but with fast microcontrollers
debouncing can be done in software to reduce hardware costs.
\hyperref[io-circuit-diagram]{Figure \ref{io-circuit-diagram}} shows how PIC did this
with their PIC16F887 44--pin demo board.

\subsection{Part 1: Debouncing \texttt{SW1}}

To test the bouncing time of the 44--pin demo board as described in
\hyperref[part-1-problem-specs]{section \ref{part-1-problem-specs}},
I decided to create a loop that tests the pushbutton switch with a
settable sampling frequency. Looking ahead to part 2 of the lab,
there should be a function that is monitoring \texttt{SW1} for an
falling edge (activation edge), but times out to allow other important
CPU work if there is no activation event within a set period of time.

My implementation for these requirements is shown in
\hyperref[monitor-sw1-function-implementation]{figure \ref{monitor-sw1-function-implementation}}.
Making an analogy to C, the piece that can be reused for the second part of the lab
is a function with no inputs that does debounce monitoring and returns 1
if an activation edge was detected or 0 if there was no activation event within
a set period of time. The steady state counter variable is implemented like a C
\texttt{static} variable so that the function has some `state' memory from the
last time the function was called. With this \texttt{static} variable, the function
will not return false activation event 1s if the pushbutton was already active before
function call.

The implementation code is shown in
\hyperref[debounce-time-code]{section \ref{debounce-time-code}}.
From counting the number of instructions and each instruction's cost,
the loop samples the pushbutton switch with a period of 14 CPU clock cycles.
With the debouncing steady state counter, this means the function can return 1
after the switch has been steadily high for
\begin{equation}
T_{\textrm{debounced}}=\textrm{\texttt{DEBOUNCE\_TIME}}*14\,\mu s
\label{debounce-period-eq}
\end{equation}
after an activation event. Furthermore, the smallest period of bouncing
that can be detected is
\begin{equation}
T_{\textrm{sampling}}=14\,\mu s
\end{equation}

\section{Expected Results}

\subsection{Debounce Time}

From Professor Vemuri's lecture,
\hyperref[debounce-handout-time-graph]{figure \ref{debounce-handout-time-graph}}
shows the timescale at which some random switch bounces.
Based on this plot, the expected bouncing time of \texttt{SW1}
was on the order of $500\, \mu s$.

\end{figure}

\section{Experiment and Design Revisions}

\subsection{Command Line Assembly}

My \texttt{.asm} source files were assembled on the command line so
please do this if they don't compile nicely in the IDE.
On Ubuntu, with the default MPLAB installation location, 
from the directory containting \texttt{catch-the-clown.asm}, the commands are:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cp /opt/microchip/mplabx/v3.10/mpasmx/p16f887.inc ./p16f887.inc
$ /opt/microchip/mplabx/v3.10/mpasmx/mpasmx -p16f887 catch-the-clown.asm
$ more catch-the-clown.ERR
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{PORTB Input}

On the 44--pin demo board, the pushbutton is connected to \texttt{RB0}
on \texttt{PORTB}, in an active low configuration with a $1k\Omega$, $10k\Omega$
voltage divider, as shown in \hyperref[io-circuit-diagram]{figure \ref{io-circuit-diagram}}.

When I first wrote my implementation for part 1 of the lab,
I could not get the $\mu$Controller to respond to pressing the
pushbutton switch (SW1). After inspecting the hardware with a ohmmeter,
I knew the problem had to be in software. I created a knew `hello world'
program for debugging the pushbutton switch.

It turns out the bug was a configuration problem: \texttt{RB0} is connected
to one of the 16 analog inputs, \texttt{AD12}. By default, the pin configured
use with the ADC and the digital input amplifiers are turned off.
Here is a nugget that was buried on page 49 of the PIC16F887 datasheet:
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/port-b-configuration-note.pdf}
	\captionof{figure}{Port B Configuration Note}
\end{center}
With this nugget, the working `pushbutton hello world' program was:
\lstinputlisting[backgroundcolor=\color{mygray}, basicstyle=\small]{Test-SW1/test-sw1.asm}

\subsection{Adjusting Debounce Time}

The results from part 1 of the lab are presented in
hyperref[part-1-results-section]{section \ref{part-1-results-section}}.
From these results, the \texttt{DEBOUNCE\_TIME} for the part 2 implementation
was adjusted to XXX to require a steady state, debouncing period of
\begin{equation*}
T=X*14\, \mu s=XXX
\end{equation*}
before a switch activation is accepted by the program.

\section{Observations}

Using the part 1 implementation shown in
\hyperref[monitor-sw1-function-implementation]{figure \ref{monitor-sw1-function-implementation}},
the PIC16F887 demo board was tested to determine the typical bounce time of
the pushbutton switch \texttt{SW1}. The implementation essentially counts the
number of activation events that occur--importantly not counting any activation events
which are not followed by an active signal for longer than \texttt{DEBOUNCE\_TIME} cycles.
The total number of activation events counted are displayed on the 8 LEDs.

The debounce time period required is given by
\begin{equation*}
T_{\textrm{steady state}}=\textrm{\texttt{DEBOUNCE\_TIME}}*14\,\mu s
\end{equation*}

The value \texttt{DEBOUNCE\_TIME} was initially set to 255 to filter out any
all bouncing with lifetimes up to $T_{\textrm{steady state}}=3.5\,ms$.
With this filter period and 30 trials, the probability of
detecting more than 1 activation edge per button press was zero.

This procedure was repeated with decreasing values for \texttt{DEBOUNCE\_TIME}
until any trial detected more than 1 activation event per button press.
This did not happen until \texttt{DEBOUNCE\_TIME} = 1.

The results using a debouncing filter period of
\begin{equation*}
T_{\textrm{steady state}}=\textrm{\texttt{1}}*14\,\mu s
\end{equation*}
are shown in \hyperref[debounce-time-results]{figure \ref{debounce-time-results}}.
Assuming that the trials are a bernoulli process, the data was
analyzed with a standard normal distribution, with average number of bounces
\begin{equation*}
\mu=1.172T_{\textrm{steady state}}=16.41\,\mu s
\end{equation*}
and standard deviation
\begin{equation*}
\sigma=0.530T_{\textrm{steady state}}=7.42\,\mu s.
\end{equation*}

For the implementation of part 2, if \texttt{DEBOUNCE\_TIME} is set to 8,
then we can estimate the probabilty of erroneously counting a an activation
event multiple times.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c c c}
P(X>8T)	&=	&1-P(X<8T)	\\
&=&	1-P\left(Z<\frac{8T-1.172T}{0.53T}\right)	\\
&=&	1-P(Z<12.88)	\\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
I could not find any tables for a Z score of 12.88, but from the highest
value I did find, the probability a bounce passing through this filter
period is certainly less than
\begin{equation*}
P(X>8T)<0.001\%
\end{equation*}
